  Quantitative Risk Calculations
    Replacement Costs or Asset Value
    Exposure Factor:  Percentage of an asset that's lost as the result of an incident
    Asset Value X Exposure Factor = Single Loss Expectancy
    ARO: Annualized Rate of Occurrence
    SLE: Single Loss Expectancy = Asset Value X Exposure Factor
    SLE X ARO = Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
    MTTR: Mean Time To Repair (similar to NPT)
    MTTF: Mean Time to Failure
    MTBF: Mean Time between Failure = MTTR + MTTF
