Risk Management:
  Assets:  Any part of our infrastructre that we are worried about being harmed.
    Infrastrucre, People, Computers...
  Vulnerability:
  Threats:
    Threat Agent
  Likelihood = level of certanity that something bad will happen
    Quantitative Likelihood
    Qualitative Likelihood: 1-10 or Low, Medium, High
  Impact:
    Quantitative Likelihood
    Qualitative Likelihood

  Quantitative Risk Calculations
    Replacement Costs or Asset Value
    Exposure Factor:  Percentage of an asset that's lost as the result of an incident
    Asset Value X Exposure Factor = Single Loss Expectancy
    ARO: Annualized Rate of Occurrence
    SLE: Single Loss Expectancy = Asset Value X Exposure Factor
    SLE X ARO = Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
    MTTR: Mean Time To Repair (similar to NPT)
    MTTF: Mean Time to Failure
    MTBF: Mean Time between Failure = MTTR + MTTF

Cryptography
  Hash Types
    Message Digest 5 (MD5) - 128 bit hash
    Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA):
      SHA-1: 160 bit hash
      SHA-2:
        SHA-256, SHA-512
    RIPEMD - RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest:
      128, 160, 256, 320 bit digests
  Hash-based Message Authentication Codes - HMAC:
    Takes a packed and adds a key
  Symmetric Algorithms:
   -Use the same key for encrypting and decrypting

  Asymmetric Algorithms
    - Uses Key-pairs to encrypt
    RSA
    Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
      - Allows for smailler keys than RSA
    Diffie-Hellman

  PKCS-7 is a way to store cetificates as individual files.
  PKCS-12 stores the certificates and the private keys as a package.
  Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is a more modern version of certification revocation list (CRL)

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

Authentication Factors
  1. Something You Know
    - Passwords
    - CAPTCHA
    - Security Questions
  2. Something You Have
    - Smart Cards
    - RSA Key (like MFA)
  3. Something About You
    - Iris Scanner
    - Finger Print Scanner
    - Facial Recongnition
  4. Something You Do
    - Your typing style
  5. Somewhere You Are

Authorization Models
  Mandatory Access Control
    - Labeling documents as Private, Confidential, Public, etc.
  Discretionary Access Control
    Whoever created the resource is the owner and has the descretion to allow others to access or modify the resource.
